# AI Agent Implementation Project

This project implements various agent patterns and workflows using CrewAI, focusing on the patterns described in Anthropic's research paper ["Building Effective Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents).

## Project Overview

This project uses:
- **UV** for Python package management (a faster alternative to pip)
- **CrewAI** for implementing agent workflows using the CrewAI Flow class
- Implementation patterns from Anthropic's agent research

## Agent Patterns

Each pattern will be implemented in separate files to maintain clarity and modularity. The patterns we'll implement include:

1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
2. Self-Reflection
3. Tool Use
4. Planning and Decomposition
5. Memory and Note-Taking
6. Verification and Self-Correction
7. Learning from Feedback
8. Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Project Structure

Each pattern will have its own implementation file under the `src/patterns` directory:

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by implementing additional patterns or improving existing implementations. Please follow the project's structure and add appropriate tests.
